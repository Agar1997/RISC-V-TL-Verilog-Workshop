# RISC-V-TL-Verilog-Workshop
This repository contains the source code, pipeline design, and example test cases created during the RISC-V & TL-Verilog workshop. The design implements a simple RISC-V processor with:
- 5-stage pipeline (IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB)
- ALU operations (ADD, SUB, AND, OR, etc.)
- Instruction and data memory integration
- Simulation and verification setup

## Tools Used
- Makerchip (online IDE for TL-Verilog)
- RISC-V GCC toolchain
